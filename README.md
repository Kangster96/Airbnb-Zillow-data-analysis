# Airbnb-Zillow-data-analysis

A real estate company that has a niche in purchasing properties to rent out short-term as part of their business model specifically within New York City wants to understand
which zip codes generate the most profit on short term rentals within New York City. The company has already concluded that two bedroom properties are the most profitable.
In this report I will analyze Airbnb data for New York’s 2 bed-room properties using Zillow’s median home value dataset that has price values from 1996 to 2017. An occupancy 
rate of 75% is assumed for the calculations.
The analysis is done on Jupyter notebook using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, pandas and numpy.
